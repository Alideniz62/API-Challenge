Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"


* Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I of the homework.


* Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.

  * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.

  * **Note:** Feel free to adjust to your specifications but be sure to limit the number of rows returned by your API requests to a reasonable number.

* Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.



As final considerations:


* You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
* You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
* For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission.
* You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
* For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.
